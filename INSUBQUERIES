-- IN SUBQUERIES can aggregate data from two different tables. It is very important to have a common column, in this example name and artist

-- I used SQL to aggregate data using an IN SUBQUERY to RETRIEVE TITLES from table SONGS only from POP genre that was declared in another table called ARTISTS. I was able to do that because both tables have something in common: the artists
SELECT title from  songs where artist IN (SELECT name from artists where genre= "Pop")
